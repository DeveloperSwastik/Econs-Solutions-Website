          <h3>Facts of Primary Education</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            Our Indian Education system has become complex, challenging and competitive at global level. It is
            necessary to devise innovative techniques to investigate and find solutions to the real world problems. In
            olden days teaching was a synthesis of economic, social, spiritual and moral values. It was meant to
            develop both the child and society to higher level of happiness and cultural coherence. But today, as a
            result of focusing primarily on commercial objectives, teaching has lost the purpose of education. In the
            present time, the focus of education should be to address the key challenges of poverty, hunger,
            inequality conflict and emerging issues of intolerance and climate change for humanity with harmony to
            build a civic society and develop responsible citizens. It is a fact that the character/personality of a
            person is developed on the basis of education and his upbringing by the family, school and society, so the
            early childhood education becomes vital and important to be monitored and guided carefully under a big
            umbrella.

          <h3>Effects</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            CEE have identified that in India we have different boards (State Board, CBSE, ICSE)to assess the
            performance of the student at secondary and senior secondary level, but there is no prescribed benchmark
            to assess the children at primary level. The government has provided free and compulsory basic education
            to the children in rural India. According to the Annual Status of Education report of 2018, over 96% of
            kids in rural India are attending the school. But, only about 8% of class III students can do basic
            subtraction and more than 60% can’t read words. By the end of class II, children are expected to be able
            to read a simple text fluently and do basic maths operations. 72.8% students of class VIII are able to
            read class II level texts and maths learning is very poor. The above data shows that the level of learning
            skills are not upto the mark. The net enrolment ratio (NER) at the elementary level in most states and
            Union territories is declining, revealing a serious challenge for the Centre and states according to the
            Niti Aayog’s school education quality index. Thus, CEE seriously thought of forming a council to assess
            the students and the performance of the teachers to raise the standard of primary schools.

          <h3>What is the need of an Hour</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            Earlier the key attention was given on 3 areas for the growth of child’s learning by the educators :-
            <br>- Understanding to get knowledge of the world
            <br>- Literacy and Numerals
            <br>- Modern Technology
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            The priority was given to 3R, i.e, Reading, writing and numericals. In modern times these aspects have less
            practical implications. Due to change in social, political, cultural, economical and spiritual the teaching-
            learning skills are outdated. It will not help the children to get success in life now as well as in future.
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            Today, it is the prime duty and responsibility of educators to focus on those skills which can make learning
            interesting and creative for the students. The teaching learning should be based on:-
            <br>-Collaboration and Team Work
            <br>-Creativity
            <br>-Positive Self-Image
            <br>-Problem Solving and Reasoning
            <br>-Independent thinking to develop the quality of leadership, self-expression, talent management etc.
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            Now a days the parents are so busy in their life that it becomes difficult for them to spend quality time
            with their children. They are substituting their responsibilities by providing the latest gadgets and tools,
            all luxuries and comforts to their children in lieu of integrating moral values and good behaviour. The
            parents expect that the school/ teachers to perform the role of parents and mentors. Parents’ attitude
            towards education does not motivate their children to study.
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            If there is a healthy relationship between the parents and teachers, the schools can rely on them in the
            cognitive and socio emotional education of their students, which is missing in our country. An ample time is
            spent by the students in the school, so it is necessary to understand whether children are happy and
            satisfied with different aspects of their life and the aspirations they have for their future. Thus to
            reduce the excessive pressure of studies, to set the strategies for encouraging goal-setting , enhancing
            motivation to learn, CEE has framed and launched “Council of Elementary Education” to standardise the
            teaching –learning practices at elementary and primary level. The council will ensure the standard mode of
            teaching and training pedagogies along with the structural module of teaching syllabus in line with the
            standard/university accepted boards like CBSE/ IGCSE/IB

          <h3>Why Council is Needed</h3>
          <p class="fst-italic justified-para">
            Education is a shared responsibility of Government schools, parents, teachers, students, etc., play an
            important role in improving education. A credible education plan is the basis for accountability. It should
            have clear targets and lines of responsibility and allocation of resources. Transparent and relevant data on
            the strength and weakness of education system is not available especially of primary education. Such data is
            required to improve teaching and learning. Government need to ensure that teachers or evaluators have the
            appropriate training to recognize good teaching and provide constructive feedback.
            A child’s success in the classroom depends on the teacher. The teaching profession in our society has low
            status. It is sad that being a universal access to primary education in our country, the children who attend
            the school do not learn much while in school. The decent salary for primary school teachers has not helped
            to attract committed, compassionate and caring teacher to these schools. They have lost the purpose in life.
            The society must respect the noble profession of teaching.In village schools the teachers from far city or
            town, very often they arrive late for the classes, easily get tired and try to leave school before the
            scheduled time. Some teachers hire ’substitutes‘ to take classes when they don’t show up . These practices
            exist due to lack of accountability wherever teachers and community around them have better ties – the
            schools are maintained better. There more number of students are present, parents are willing to collaborate
            and
            cooperate – thereby making the process of learning more effective. After independence we had still not
            achieved the goal of universal free primary
            primary education. It is the lack of accountability among the teachers in
            primary schools, absence of innovation in the curriculum, failure to match education to the changing needs
            of a fast growing economy and lack of awareness of the desperate need for excellence in a world where
            economic barriers are crumbling and competition between nations is becoming fiercer by the day.
            (Education World January 14 ) The shortage of school teachers is made more acute by chronic absenteeism,
            lack of teaching aids , wastage of resources, less coordination of curriculum , teaching standards and fees.
            These areas need the most attention at every level of education.
