                    Tyre Care
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    <br><b>1. MEASURING TREAD WEAR</b> <br>
                    The tread of a tyre determines how a tyre grips the road surface. The tread depth of a tyre is a
                    critical aspect of ensuring safety and maneuvering. The function of tread grooves is to disperse
                    water from under the tyre while in motion. The more tread depth, the better control and lesser risk
                    and better life of the tyre.<br><br>

                    <b>2. TYRE PRESSURE</b><br>
                    Maintaining right tyre pressure along with regular maintenance of the vehicle contribute towards the
                    life of a tyre. Resulting in better fuel efficiency and control of the vehicle driving. It,s
                    advisable to check tyre pressure, that of the spare on routine basis and before long journeys,
                    preferably when the tyre are cold.<br>

                    Underinflated tyres increases tread wear on the tyre´s edges and generate excessive heat while in
                    motion. The tyres go soft, increases rolling resistance and reducing fuel economy. Overinflated
                    tyre, on the other hand, increases wear on the centre tread.<br>

                    The tyre is cold. The tyre is cold when your motorcycle has not been ridden for more than 2 hrs.
                    Always remove a tyre from service once the wear level reaches to tread wear indication bar located
                    in grooves of the tyre ( the height of tread wear indicator is 0.8 mm).<br><br>

                    <b>3. WHEEL BALANCING</b><br>
                    An out of balance wheel may cause uneven, rapid tread wear on your tyres and also causes vibration
                    while driving your vehicle. Keeping your wheels in good balance cuts down vibration and averts
                    premature wear of the tyre treads. It also helps extend the life of the vehicle´s steering system,
                    suspension and bearings. If on area of your vehicle feels heavier or lighter than others, it´s a cue
                    that your wheels may be out of balance. It´s advisable to go for wheels balancing each time a tyre
                    is replaced, a balance weight is moved or when you put new tyres.<br><br>

                    <b>4. VALVE INSPECTION</b><br>
                    Valves and valve caps ensure an airtight seal in your tyre and are critical to maintaining proper
                    tyre pressure over longer periods. They are an inexpensive way to ensure longer tyre life and
                    driving safety. Usually made of rubber, valves and their components are subject to deterioration,
                    cracking and bending over time . when you drive at high speeds a weakened valve can lead to air loss
                    compromising safety. Ensure the placement of valve cap at all times. It is recommended to have
                    periodic checking of valve of tyre-rim assembly and replacing the valve as soon any cracks are
                    observed.<br><br>

                    <b>5. MAXIMUM TYRE SPEED</b><br>
                    Riding at high speed is dangerous, and can cause a motorcycle accident, including serious personal
                    injury or death. The speed can vary depending on traffic, weather, vehicle, road conditions or
                    permitted by low. No tyre, regardless of its desing or speed rating, has unlimited capacity for
                    speed and a sudden failure can occur if its limits are exceeded. Never exceed the speed in
                    comparison to maximum speed rating stamped on the tyre sidewall of your tyre or the maximum vehicle
                    speed rating, whichever is less.<br><br>

                    <b>6. CORRECT FITMENT</b><br>
                    Always ensure that two wheeler is equipped with the tyre size specified by motorcycle manufacturer
                    in owner´s manual or manufacturer´s website. It is extremely important that the proper size of rim
                    is used for your tyre. Be sure to match your tyre size against the size mentioned on rim.<br><br>

                    <b>7. LOAD ON TYRE</b><br>
                    Riding your motorcycle in an overloaded condition is dangerous. Overloading causes excessive heat to
                    build up in your tyres. This can lead to sudden tyre failure and serious personal injury or death
                    while the tyre is overloaded. Never exceed the maximum load rating stamped on the tyre sidewall of
                    your tyre or the maximum vehicle load rating, whichever is less.<br><br>

                    <br>Dewan Tyres undergo stringent quality tests upon production. They are put through a series of
                    examination like plunger test, wobbling test, endurance test etc. on sophisticated testing machines
                    to ensure quality, safety and durability of the tyres. <br><br>

                    <b>Endurance Test:</b> Tyres are subjected to 50% higher load than recommended to determine their
                    life and
                    load bearing capacity. <br>
                    <b>Plunger Test:</b> Tyre carcass is subjected to a testing machine that penetrates it in full force
                    to
                    determine its strength.<br>
                    <b>Dry Braking Test:</b> Tyres are tested for the distance travelled after applying emergency
                    brakes.<br>
                    <b>Wet Braking Test:</b> Tyres are tested on wet surfaces for road grip when brakes are applied.<br>
                    <b>Wear Resistance Test:</b> Tyres are subjected to carry heavy loads in actual riding conditions
                    both on
                    road and off road for durability testing.<br>
                    <b>Wobbling Test:</b> Tyres are subjected to an advanced wobbling test for ensuring rides without
                    bumps and
                    shakes.
